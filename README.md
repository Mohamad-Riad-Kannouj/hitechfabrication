# hitechfabrication
This is my first project as a freelancer. I used HTML, CSS, vanilla javascript, and bootstrap to build the client side, and I used nodeJS, and ExpressJS to build our backend and API app.
Also, I deployed the website on NameCheap.

This is the list of npm packages used with our nodeJS app:
    1- express 
    2- body-parser
    3- convert-excel-to-json
    4- cors
    5- node-fetch
    6- nodemailer
